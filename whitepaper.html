A Philanthropic Token with Automatic Burn & Donation Mechanisms
Date: April 2025

Abstract

Heard and McDonald Islands Crypto (HMDI) is an innovative ERC20 token deployed on the Polygon network. With a fixed total supply of 10 billion tokens, HMDI introduces a unique blend of automatic burn mechanisms, tariff fee allocation, and philanthropic donation features designed to support penguin research. Each transaction automatically deducts a 1% fee (sent directly to a dedicated penguin research wallet) and burns a portion of tokens via a two-phase process to gradually reduce the circulating supply and potentially increase value over time. Additionally, token holders can voluntarily donate tokens through dedicated functions, including a mechanism that swaps part of the donation for MATIC (Polygon’s native coin) before burning the remainder.

Introduction

The Heard and McDonald Islands, remote and uninhabited, serve as a symbolic inspiration for HMDI. In a world where cryptocurrencies are evolving rapidly, HMDI aims to combine financial innovation with social responsibility. By automatically allocating a portion of every transaction fee to support penguin research, HMDI creates a sustainable funding model for environmental initiatives while providing potential value growth through scarcity.

Tokenomics

Total Supply: 10,000,000,000 HMDI (10 billion tokens with 18 decimals)
Initial Allocation:
Developer Allocation: 2,000,000,000 tokens (20%)
Treasury Allocation: 8,000,000,000 tokens (80%)
Transaction Fee: 1% tariff fee on each non‑exempt transfer; sent directly to the penguin research wallet.
Automatic Burn Mechanism:
Phase 1: Burn exactly 1 token (1e18 units) per transaction until a cumulative total of 50 million tokens have been burned.
Phase 2: Once Phase 1 is complete, burn 1% of each transaction’s amount until an additional 10 million tokens have been burned.
Donation Functions:
donateBurn: Allows token holders to make fee‑free donations (manual burns) directly to the penguin research wallet.
donateBurnAndSwap: Splits a donation: half of the tokens are swapped for MATIC (which is sent to the penguin wallet), and the other half are burned.
Technical Overview

Smart Contract Features
Deployment on Polygon:
The HMDI token is deployed on the Polygon network to take advantage of low gas fees and fast transactions.
Automatic Burn Logic:
The contract employs a two-phase automatic burn process to gradually decrease the token supply:
In Phase 1, a fixed amount (1 token per transaction) is burned until 50 million tokens are burned.
In Phase 2, 1% of the transaction amount is burned until an additional 10 million tokens are burned.
Fee Allocation:
A 1% fee on each token transfer (excluding fee‑exempt addresses) is automatically sent to the penguin research wallet, ensuring continuous funding for research.
Donation Mechanisms:
Token holders have two ways to contribute:
Direct Donation: donateBurn sends tokens directly to the penguin wallet without fees.
Split Donation: donateBurnAndSwap swaps half of the donated tokens for MATIC (using QuickSwap) and sends the proceeds to the penguin wallet while burning the remaining tokens.
Security Measures:
The contract uses the latest OpenZeppelin libraries, including ReentrancyGuard for external functions and stores fee‑exempt addresses as hashed values (using keccak256) to add a layer of security. Ownership is renounced upon deployment, ensuring that no further modifications can be made to the core parameters.
External Dependencies
QuickSwap Router & WMATIC:
The contract integrates with QuickSwap for on-chain token swaps, converting part of a donation to MATIC. The WMATIC address represents Polygon’s native wrapped MATIC token.
OpenZeppelin Libraries:
Utilizing audited libraries (ERC20, Ownable, ReentrancyGuard) ensures best practices in security and contract design.
Roadmap

Phase 1: Launch & Community Building
Finalize and audit the smart contract.
Deploy HMDI on the Polygon mainnet.
Launch the project website and whitepaper on GitHub Pages.
Initiate community outreach via social media and crypto forums.
Phase 2: Exchange Listings & Ecosystem Integration
Work toward listing HMDI on decentralized (DEX) and centralized (CEX) exchanges.
Integrate HMDI with decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, such as staking pools and liquidity mining programs.
Develop a community governance model to allow token holders to vote on future initiatives.
Phase 3: Expansion & Future-Proofing
Explore partnerships with environmental organizations and research institutions.
Investigate potential upgrades to incorporate quantum-resistant cryptographic methods as they become standardized.
Expand the ecosystem by enabling additional utility for HMDI (e.g., as a means of payment or in NFT marketplaces).
Conclusion

Heard and McDonald Islands Crypto (HMDI) is more than just another token—it is a movement that marries financial innovation with environmental philanthropy. By leveraging an automatic burn mechanism, a sustainable fee allocation system, and user-driven donation features, HMDI aims to create long-term value for investors while directly supporting penguin research. We invite you to join our community, participate in our ecosystem, and be part of a pioneering project that stands at the intersection of technology and social good.
